\section{Numerical Results}

The following simulations were done using MATLAB.\ 
The optimisation problems were formulated and solved using the CasADi package by \cite{Andersson2019casadi} and the Ipopt solver by \cite{Waechter2006ipopt}.\
Perfect prediction is assumed.\ 
%\subsection{Fractional Brownian Motion Noise}

\subsection{Accuracy of Model-predictive Control}

\subsection{Weight selection algorithm}
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the weight selection algorithm by simulating the system's behaviour for different sea states.\ 
The $\nw=15$ fixed weights were found using the AWDS algorithm by \cite{Ryu2019} for the initial optimization.\ 
We compare for three different wave scenarios the performance of the \ac{mpc} with weight controller for two target damage values $\Jd = \left\{0.35, 0.5\right\}$.\ 
The performance of a weighting is evaluated every \SI{25}{\second}.\ 
An increase of the damage weighting is allowed after each evaluation, a decrease only every two evaluations.
