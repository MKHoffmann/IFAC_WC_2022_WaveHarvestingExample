\subsection{Model-predictive Control}
\ac{mpc} arose from optimal control as one answer on how to \qm{close the loop} (\cite{rawlings2017mpc}).\ 
In optimal control, a system's behaviour is predicted into the future, while optimising the inputs to the system, such that a cost function is minimised.\
The working principle of \ac{mpc} is repeatedly solving an \ac{ocp}, only applying the first of the calculated inputs, and measuring the system's state.\
