\subsection{Background}
In this work, we investigate the \ac{mpc} of the wave surge converter (see, e.g. \cite{Whittaker2012}), displayed in \figref{fig:flap}.\ 
The device is pivoted to the sea, such that incoming waves excite an oscillatory motion.\ 
This motion distorts a \ac{deg} mounted to a deformable parallelogram \cite{Moretti2014}.\ 
Through this parallelogram, the \ac{deg} applies a torque to the flap towards the equilibrium position $\theta=0$.\ 
Applying a voltage to the \ac{deg} adds an electrostatically-induced torque in the same angular direction, making the system stiffer.\ 

When a voltage is applied to the \ac{deg}, charge carrier accumulate in the \ac{deg}.\ 
By deforming the parallelogram to a smaller area, the charge density increases, such that energy can be extracted.\  
As we showed in our previous work \cite{Hoffmann2022moocp_wcdeg}, controlling the input to maximise the energy extracted from the system requires application of large voltages, damaging the \ac{deg}-material over time, and resulting in system failure after too much damage accumulated \cite{Chen2019}.\
For that reason, we also took the damage into consideration as a second control goal, resulting in lower electric fields in the \ac{deg}.

\subsection{Model}
The dynamics of the wave surge 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dynamics}
	\begin{split}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\dot{\theta} \\
			\dot{\delta}  \\
			\dot{z}
		\end{bmatrix}
		& = \begin{bmatrix}
			0 & 1 & 0^{1\times n} \\
			-I_h^{-1}K_h & -I_h^{-1}B_h & -I_h^{-1}C_r \\[3pt]
			0^{n\times 1} & B_r & A_r
		\end{bmatrix}    \begin{bmatrix}
			{\theta} \\
			{\delta}  \\
			{z}
		\end{bmatrix} +  \\ &  + \begin{bmatrix}
			0 \\
			I_h^{-1}  \\
			0^{n\times 1}
		\end{bmatrix} \left(d -C_0\theta u \right),
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
contain the equation of angular motion and the wave loads generated by the interaction of the waves with the flap.\ 
Here, $\delta = \dot{\theta}$ describes the flap's angular velocity and $z \in \mathbb{R}^n$ the $n$-dimensional state vector for wave radiation (\cite{Yu1995}).\
The input $u$ is the electrostatic force generated by the \ac{deg} when a voltage $v$ is applied.\ 
Since the \ac{deg}'s electrostatic force is proportional to the $v^2$, $u$ is restricted to be positive.

\subsection{Cost functions}
Our aim is the simultaneous minimisation of damage and maximisation of extracted energy, which we will employ in a \ac{moocp} setting.\ 
The extracted energy cost function is modelled as the negative generated energy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:J1}
	\begin{split}
		& J_1 = \Psi(t_f)-\Psi(0) +\int_0^{t_f} \left(B_h\dot{\theta}^2 +z^\intercal S_r z +\dfrac{u}{R_0} - d \dot{\theta}\right) \text{d}t \\
		& \text{with}\ \Psi = \dfrac{1}{2}I_h\dot{\theta}^2+\dfrac{1}{2}K_h{\theta}^2+ \dfrac{1}{2}z^\intercal Q_r z + \dfrac{1}{2} C_0\left(1 - \theta^2 \right) u,
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
with the storage function $\psi$ including kinematic, potential, electrostatic, and hydrodynamic energy contributions.\ 
Dissipations due to viscous, hydrodynamic, and electrical losses, and the power input by the incident wave are considered via the integral terms.\ 
\todo{more explanations?, see mathmod paper}

Under the assumption, that damage only starts accumulating after the applied electric field exceeds a threshold $\Eth$, the cost function can be formulated as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:J2}
	J_2 = \alpha \int_0^{t_f} \left(\max \{ \cos^2(\theta)u-E_{th}^2 h_l^2,0 \} \right)^{n_d} \text{d}t,
\end{equation}
with a normalisation factor $\alpha$ rendering $J_2$ dimensionless and an experimental parameter $n_\mathrm{d}$.\
