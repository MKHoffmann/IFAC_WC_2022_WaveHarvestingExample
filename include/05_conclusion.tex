\section{Conclusion}
This work analyses the usage of model-predictive control for dielectric elastomer generator-based wave energy converters under the influence of stochastic waves.\ 
Compared to previous work, MPC is considered for control, as it gives more flexibility to changes in the prediction than optimal control, while still regarding the energetic and damage cost functions.\ 
A comparison to a ground truth OCP solution shows that the MPC deviates from it considerably, if the prediction horizon does not cover multiple base periods of the acting stochastic waves.\ 
As the sea state changes over time, the meaning of the weighting of the two cost functions changes, resulting is very different...
