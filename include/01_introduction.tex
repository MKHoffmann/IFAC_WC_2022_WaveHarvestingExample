\section{Introduction}
\acp{wec} are one of the most promising techniques for extracting energy from ocean waves.\ 
Although many different form s of \acp{wec} were studied in the last years (\todo{add citations to OWC and this snake like thing?}), their high technological complexity and deployment costs have hindered these technologies from being used in the field.\ 
One promising solution to these problems is the usage of \acp{deg}.

Our contribution is the exploration of \ac{mpc} for \ac{deg}-\acp{wec} influenced by panchromatic waves.\ 
For that, we evaluate the deviation of the \ac{mpc} solution with a ground truth \ac{ocp} input signal to find reasonable prediction horizon lengths.\ 
Additionally, the ever-changing conditions, under which the presented system operates, demand for an adapting controller if long-time goals are to be met.\ 
This adaptation is achieved using a simple heuristic for changing the weights in the \ac{moocp} scheme.
