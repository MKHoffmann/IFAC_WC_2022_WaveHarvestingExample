# IFAC_WC_2022_WaveHarvestingExample
This repository contains exemplary MATLAB code to track and reproduce the results from our paper "Multi-objective Model-Predictive Control for Dielectric Elastomer Wave Harvesters".
The file StochasticWaveMPC.m contains an example for a fixed-weight MPC.
The example StochasticWaveMPCDamageController.m employs our proposed heuristic weight controller for reaching long-time goals.

# Prerequisites
